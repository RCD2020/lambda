# Part 7 Q&A

## What, in your opinion, is an important part of code reviews? That is, what is something you pay attention to when you review code, and that you appreciate when others do the same for your code?

In my opinion, an important part of code reviews to pay attention to is making sure to comment your code, short and to the point. Obviously longer comments are allowed for more complex parts, but comments should not be repetitive, only clear and concise.

## We have an awful lot of computers here, and it gets pretty confusing with slightly different things running on all of them. How could containers help us improve this situation?

Containers can improve the situation by allowing you to have secluded programs that won't interfere or be interfered with by other programs on your computer. That way, you do not have to have multiple computers, and can still operate without the worry of not acknowledging your dependencies.
