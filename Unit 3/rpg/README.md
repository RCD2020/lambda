# Assignment Questions: sqlite3 to mongoDB

## How was working with MongoDB different from working with PostgreSQL?

Well, I'll tell you what, the biggest difference is that I could
actually use ProstgreSQL, where the MongoDB servers were way to full
to use. However, if the MongoDB server were actually working, I would
say that the biggest difference was that PostgreSQL used a lot of SQL,
where MongoDB already had all the SQL built for us in easy to use
functions.

## What was easier, and what was harder?

Server congestion aside, I would actually argue that MongoDB is a lot
easier to use than PostgreSQL, because instead of using SQL, we're
using python functions, something that we're already used to, and not
to mention that python functions will come with documentation to guide
us in the right direction.
